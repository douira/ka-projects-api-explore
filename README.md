# ka-projects-api-explore
Uses the KhanAcademy API to get and display programming projects

## Code Style
This project uses my `.eslintrc.json` file from [resolution-editor](https://github.com/douira/resolution-editor) with a few minotr differences (like the `semi` rule being changed to not allow semicolons where not necessary).
